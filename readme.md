## ShareMe

This project is base on a YouTube tutorial by [Adrian Hajdin - JSMastery](https://github.com/adrianhajdin) for developing a Social Media Application based on Pinterest where you can create, save, comment and share pins.

Also, we developed some search functionality and divided by category.

Unlike the original project, I chose to use [Nextjs] instead of using pure react because of the SSG and SSR. Also I added typescript.

As an extra part, I added a next-js progressbar and a toaster for some user interation.
